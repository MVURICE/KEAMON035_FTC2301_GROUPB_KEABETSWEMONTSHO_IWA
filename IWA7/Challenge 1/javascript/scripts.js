const value = 3
console.log(value + 4 + value)

// The mistake in the code is that the values are being concatenated as strings, rather than added as numbers. When the first value, "3", is added to the number 4, JavaScript coerces the number 4 into a string and concatenates it with "3" to produce the string "34". Then when "3" is added again, it is concatenated with "34" to produce the string "343".
